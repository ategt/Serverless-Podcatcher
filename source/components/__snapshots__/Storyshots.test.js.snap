    #1941: Bryology This, Pal
  
  </div>
   
  <div
    class="item-description"
  >
    This week on The Best of Car Talk, Jenny's fiance, a budding bryologist, thinks she's crazy because she swears her car is more difficult to start when its low on gas. Should he stick to moss and stay away from fuel dynamics, let alone female psychology? Elsewhere, Angela's smelling something sweet from her dashboard, but the cost to fix it will be mighty sour; Eric is wondering how a $4 part could require $358 in labor to replace; and David is trying to decide which of two heaps to dump, when the answer should probably be both. And, in the midst of New England foliage season, New Hampshire native Kurt has lots of time in traffic to profile the tourist drivers slowing him down the most. All this and more, this week on the Best of Car Talk.

  <div
    class="item-description"
  >
    This week on The Best of Car Talk, Fran and her boyfriend are both jocks, and as a result her Taurus smells like a locker room. Will a few dozen Odor Eaters hanging from the rear view mirror get rid of the stink? Elsewhere, Fritzie has two Peugeots, one of which has died. Should she keep it around, so its partner has company? Also, Margo's Dad gave her his Cadillac, but her noisy brakes have Tom and Ray convinced Dad may be trying to bump Margo off; Matt wants to cure his wife of her habitual door slamming; and "Martha" bought a used van from a  dealer six months ago, but has yet to be billed or pay a single cent for it. Should she keep quiet, 'fess up, or trade it in for a new van? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.

    #1942: A Bevy of Bad Options
  
  </div>
   
  <div
    class="item-description"
  >
    This week on The Best of Car Talk, should Bill risk humiliation and passenger nausea by trying to learn how to drive a sitck shift in time for the high school dance? Given that his options are the family minivan or station wagon, he may need to go for it, and have a handy supply of barf bags on hand. Elsewhere, Jane's neighbor's dog is biting her Subaru's tires and chasing her car. Jane is thinking a healthy dose of pepper spray may help dissuade Fido, but Tom and Ray may have a more (or less ) humane solution. Also, Abby's Accord has a burning smell since she accidentally backed down a friend's steep driveway in drive; Steve promised his wife he could fix her oil problem three months ago, but is stumped; and can Ray convince John his air conditioning is making noise, even when it's off? All this, plus a quiz for the Philosopher King, and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.

    #1943: Cream Rinse
  
  </div>
   
  <div
    class="item-description"
  >
    This week on The Best of Car Talk, Tom and Ray stray ever further into terra incognita, as they try to help Sharon figure out why her hair looks lousy after a long drive. Procter and Gamble may have issues with Ray's diagnosis. Elsewhere, Sharon's car is making a "lurid groan" when she turns. The noise is making her a star at the retirement home, but should she be worried about it? Also, from the marital disputes department, Cathy thinks her husband erred by driving down Mt. Washington in 1st gear rather than riding the brakes; and Lynn is worried that a cold water car wash on a hot day can warp her brakes. And, has the New York Times really found the world's funniest joke? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.

Also, Margo's Dad gave her his Cadillac, but her noisy brakes have Tom and Ray convinced Dad may be trying to bump Margo off; Matt wants to cure his wife of her habitual door slamming; and "Martha" bought a used van from a  dealer six months ago, but has yet to be billed or pay a single cent for it. Should she keep quiet, 'fess up, or trade it in for a new van? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.

          This week on The Best of Car Talk, Fran and her boyfriend are both jocks, and as a result her Taurus smells like a locker room. Will a few dozen Odor Eaters hanging from the rear view mirror get rid of the stink? Elsewhere, Fritzie has two Peugeots, one of which has died. Should she keep it around, so its partner has company? Also, Margo's Dad gave her his Cadillac, but her noisy brakes have Tom and Ray convinced Dad may be trying to bump Margo off; Matt wants to cure his wife of her habitual door slamming; and "Martha" bought a used van from a  dealer six months ago, but has yet to be billed or pay a single cent for it. Should she keep quiet, 'fess up, or trade it in for a new van? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.

          This week on The Best of Car Talk, Fran and her boyfriend are both jocks, and as a result her Taurus smells like a locker room. Will a few dozen Odor Eaters hanging from the rear view mirror get rid of the stink? Elsewhere, Fritzie has two Peugeots, one of which has died. Should she keep it around, so its partner has company? Also, Margo's Dad gave her his Cadillac, but her noisy brakes have Tom and Ray convinced Dad may be trying to bump Margo off; Matt wants to cure his wife of her habitual door slamming; and "Martha" bought a used van from a  dealer six months ago, but has yet to be billed or pay a single cent for it. Should she keep quiet, 'fess up, or trade it in for a new van? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.

Also, Margo's Dad gave her his Cadillac, but her noisy brakes have Tom and Ray convinced Dad may be trying to bump Margo off; Matt wants to cure his wife of her habitual door slamming; and "Martha" bought a used van from a  dealer six months ago, but has yet to be billed or pay a single cent for it. Should she keep quiet, 'fess up, or trade it in for a new van? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.

          This week on The Best of Car Talk, Fran and her boyfriend are both jocks, and as a result her Taurus smells like a locker room. Will a few dozen Odor Eaters hanging from the rear view mirror get rid of the stink? Elsewhere, Fritzie has two Peugeots, one of which has died. Should she keep it around, so its partner has company? Also, Margo's Dad gave her his Cadillac, but her noisy brakes have Tom and Ray convinced Dad may be trying to bump Margo off; Matt wants to cure his wife of her habitual door slamming; and "Martha" bought a used van from a  dealer six months ago, but has yet to be billed or pay a single cent for it. Should she keep quiet, 'fess up, or trade it in for a new van? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.

          This week on The Best of Car Talk, Fran and her boyfriend are both jocks, and as a result her Taurus smells like a locker room. Will a few dozen Odor Eaters hanging from the rear view mirror get rid of the stink? Elsewhere, Fritzie has two Peugeots, one of which has died. Should she keep it around, so its partner has company? Also, Margo's Dad gave her his Cadillac, but her noisy brakes have Tom and Ray convinced Dad may be trying to bump Margo off; Matt wants to cure his wife of her habitual door slamming; and "Martha" bought a used van from a  dealer six months ago, but has yet to be billed or pay a single cent for it. Should she keep quiet, 'fess up, or trade it in for a new van? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.

          This week on The Best of Car Talk, Tom and Ray stray ever further into terra incognita, as they try to help Sharon figure out why her hair looks lousy after a long drive. Procter and Gamble may have issues with Ray's diagnosis. Elsewhere, Sharon's car is making a "lurid groan" when she turns. The noise is making her a star at the retirement home, but should she be worried about it? Also, from the marital disputes department, Cathy thinks her husband erred by driving down Mt. Washington in 1st gear rather than riding the brakes; and Lynn is worried that a cold water car wash on a hot day can warp her brakes. And, has the New York Times really found the world's funniest joke? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.

          This week on The Best of Car Talk, should Bill risk humiliation and passenger nausea by trying to learn how to drive a sitck shift in time for the high school dance? Given that his options are the family minivan or station wagon, he may need to go for it, and have a handy supply of barf bags on hand. Elsewhere, Jane's neighbor's dog is biting her Subaru's tires and chasing her car. Jane is thinking a healthy dose of pepper spray may help dissuade Fido, but Tom and Ray may have a more (or less ) humane solution. Also, Abby's Accord has a burning smell since she accidentally backed down a friend's steep driveway in drive; Steve promised his wife he could fix her oil problem three months ago, but is stumped; and can Ray convince John his air conditioning is making noise, even when it's off? All this, plus a quiz for the Philosopher King, and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.

    #1941: Bryology This, Pal

          This week on The Best of Car Talk, Jenny's fiance, a budding bryologist, thinks she's crazy because she swears her car is more difficult to start when its low on gas. Should he stick to moss and stay away from fuel dynamics, let alone female psychology? Elsewhere, Angela's smelling something sweet from her dashboard, but the cost to fix it will be mighty sour; Eric is wondering how a $4 part could require $358 in labor to replace; and David is trying to decide which of two heaps to dump, when the answer should probably be both. And, in the midst of New England foliage season, New Hampshire native Kurt has lots of time in traffic to profile the tourist drivers slowing him down the most. All this and more, this week on the Best of Car Talk.

          This week on The Best of Car Talk, Fran and her boyfriend are both jocks, and as a result her Taurus smells like a locker room. Will a few dozen Odor Eaters hanging from the rear view mirror get rid of the stink? Elsewhere, Fritzie has two Peugeots, one of which has died. Should she keep it around, so its partner has company? Also, Margo's Dad gave her his Cadillac, but her noisy brakes have Tom and Ray convinced Dad may be trying to bump Margo off; Matt wants to cure his wife of her habitual door slamming; and "Martha" bought a used van from a  dealer six months ago, but has yet to be billed or pay a single cent for it. Should she keep quiet, 'fess up, or trade it in for a new van? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.

Will a few dozen Odor Eaters hanging from the rear view mirror get rid of the stink? Elsewhere, Fritzie has two Peugeots, one of which has died. Should she keep it around, so its partner has company? Also, Margo's Dad gave her his Cadillac, but her noisy brakes have Tom and Ray convinced Dad may be trying to bump Margo off; Matt wants to cure his wife of her habitual door slamming; and "Martha" bought a used van from a  dealer six months ago, but has yet to be billed or pay a single cent for it. Should she keep quiet, 'fess up, or trade it in for a new van? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.

          This week on The Best of Car Talk, Fran and her boyfriend are both jocks, and as a result her Taurus smells like a locker room. Will a few dozen Odor Eaters hanging from the rear view mirror get rid of the stink? Elsewhere, Fritzie has two Peugeots, one of which has died. Should she keep it around, so its partner has company? Also, Margo's Dad gave her his Cadillac, but her noisy brakes have Tom and Ray convinced Dad may be trying to bump Margo off; Matt wants to cure his wife of her habitual door slamming; and "Martha" bought a used van from a  dealer six months ago, but has yet to be billed or pay a single cent for it. Should she keep quiet, 'fess up, or trade it in for a new van? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.

          This week on The Best of Car Talk, Fran and her boyfriend are both jocks, and as a result her Taurus smells like a locker room. Will a few dozen Odor Eaters hanging from the rear view mirror get rid of the stink? Elsewhere, Fritzie has two Peugeots, one of which has died. Should she keep it around, so its partner has company? Also, Margo's Dad gave her his Cadillac, but her noisy brakes have Tom and Ray convinced Dad may be trying to bump Margo off; Matt wants to cure his wife of her habitual door slamming; and "Martha" bought a used van from a  dealer six months ago, but has yet to be billed or pay a single cent for it. Should she keep quiet, 'fess up, or trade it in for a new van? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.

          This week on The Best of Car Talk, Tom and Ray stray ever further into terra incognita, as they try to help Sharon figure out why her hair looks lousy after a long drive. Procter and Gamble may have issues with Ray's diagnosis. Elsewhere, Sharon's car is making a "lurid groan" when she turns. The noise is making her a star at the retirement home, but should she be worried about it? Also, from the marital disputes department, Cathy thinks her husband erred by driving down Mt. Washington in 1st gear rather than riding the brakes; and Lynn is worried that a cold water car wash on a hot day can warp her brakes. And, has the New York Times really found the world's funniest joke? All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.

          This week on The Best of Car Talk, should Bill risk humiliation and passenger nausea by trying to learn how to drive a sitck shift in time for the high school dance? Given that his options are the family minivan or station wagon, he may need to go for it, and have a handy supply of barf bags on hand. Elsewhere, Jane's neighbor's dog is biting her Subaru's tires and chasing her car. Jane is thinking a healthy dose of pepper spray may help dissuade Fido, but Tom and Ray may have a more (or less ) humane solution. Also, Abby's Accord has a burning smell since she accidentally backed down a friend's steep driveway in drive; Steve promised his wife he could fix her oil problem three months ago, but is stumped; and can Ray convince John his air conditioning is making noise, even when it's off? All this, plus a quiz for the Philosopher King, and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.

          This week on The Best of Car Talk, Jenny's fiance, a budding bryologist, thinks she's crazy because she swears her car is more difficult to start when its low on gas. Should he stick to moss and stay away from fuel dynamics, let alone female psychology? Elsewhere, Angela's smelling something sweet from her dashboard, but the cost to fix it will be mighty sour; Eric is wondering how a $4 part could require $358 in labor to replace; and David is trying to decide which of two heaps to dump, when the answer should probably be both. And, in the midst of New England foliage season, New Hampshire native Kurt has lots of time in traffic to profile the tourist drivers slowing him down the most. All this and more, this week on the Best of Car Talk.
